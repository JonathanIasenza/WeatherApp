# WeatherApp
Hello! Welcome to my Weather App.

**The "fake login api" was built on JSON-Server, but I uploaded the json to JSONbin.io, so no need to run it on another port.
**

##Usage:

1) First, clone the project so you can run it on your own pc.

2) Run the "npm i" command to install dependencies.

3) Run the "npm start" command to run the project on port 3000.

4) Log in with the user "jiasenza" and the password "12345" (it is encrypted with md5).

5) Search for the city you want at any time, and add them to your favorites!


I uploaded the project to Firebase, here you can see the link:
https://weatherapp-iasenza.web.app
(Note: in some browsers like Opera the api does not work due to https problems, but in chrome and cell phones it works 100%)
